				<h3>Connecting academics and professional goals: Internships and Peer teaching</h3>

				<img class="img-fluid" src="SummerInternshipSymposium.jpg" alt="" >
				<img class="img-fluid" src="1-how-are-you-feeling-today.jpg" alt="">
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>I work with students to develop professional skills outside the context of core classes. I teach a companion class for CSE majors taking industry internships. In this class, students
					work to
					identify and deepen the connections between their UCSD studies and real-world problems presented
					in off-campus
					internships. Students reflect on the growth of their professional, problem-solving, and
					technical skills over the internship,
					as well as the ethical and societal impact of their work.
					At the culmination of this course, students present posters at the Summer Internship Symposium
					early in
					the Fall Quarter. The Symposium celebrates our students' accomplishments and strengthens
					the ties between the CSE department and our alumni and industry colleagues. </p>

				<p>The Summer Internship Symposium was featured in the UCTV CSE Channel <a
						href="https://youtu.be/wYV-ixiwE6E" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/wYV-ixiwE6E</a>.

				<p>I also teach the professional development classes taken by all first-time CSE tutors and all first-time CSE teaching assistants. This hands-on class builds on educational literature and gives many opportunities for role playing, skill building, and feedback.</p>

				<h3>Grading: Adaptive rubrics and oral exams</h3>
				<p>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="RubricDecisionTree.png" alt="Adaptive Rubrics">
				</p><p>
					Grading serves an important pedagogical role, both in giving feedback to students to support their learning and in certifying this learning. Effective and efficient grading at scale presents multiple challenges. 
					The adaptive rubrics project is joint work with Marco Carmosino, proposing a new framework for grading based on exploratory data analysis to mine
					insights on population statistics of learning outcome achievements across the class, along with
					efficient and consistent grading at scale. Drawing lessons from emergency remote instructions, colleagues and I explored oral exams as a modality for authentic, integrous evaluation of student learning. Across multiple projects, we explored different instantations of oral exams, designing for scale, student sense of belonging, and academic integrity.

				<h4>Summer Academy for Incoming Transfer Students (<a href="http://academy.eng.ucsd.edu/"
						target="_blank">Website</a>)</h4>

				<p>Summer Academy serves incoming transfer students entering UC San Diego in the Fall quarter
					typcially from a community college. It is a five-week program where students take gateway
					courses for their major that are not typically offered at community colleges. The Academy also
					includes advising and other activities to help students smoothly transition to UC San Diego.

				</p>

				<p><b>My role:</b> Mentor training and CSE Seminar lead (2016)</p>

				<h4>SPIS: Summer Program for Incoming Students (<a href="http://spis.ucsd.edu/"
						target="_blank">Website</a>)</h4>

				<p> SPIS (pronounced "spice") gives students college-level exposure to computer science, emphasizing
					problem-solving, communication skills, and mathematical modeling. It is a 5-week residential
					summer program on the UC San Diego campus for students accepted into CSE majors as well as for
					other UCSD admitted students who want to explore computer science as a career option.
					Students in the program interact with a wide range of CSE faculty and learn about computer
					science and engineering research.
					They also have opportunities to connect with engineers from the computer industry. SPIS provides
					an excellent student experience with individual meetings with faculty, tutoring from experienced
					CSE undergraduate students, collaborations with fellow students, individual advising to smooth
					the transition to UCSD, and living on campus.
				</p>

				<p><b>My role:</b> SPIS Faculty (2013-2016)</p>

				<h4>Communication (<a href="http://mathcomm.org/" target="_blank">Website</a>)</h4>
				<p>MathDL Mathematical Communication is a developing collection of resources for engaging students
					in writing and speaking about mathematics, whether for the purpose of learning mathematics or of
					learning to communicate as mathematicians.
					This site originated in the MIT Department of Mathematics, which offers about ten
					communication-intensive courses, many of which are led by a different instructor each semester.
					The department created a website to engage and support this community of instructors and to
					facilitate the archiving of course materials and the gleaning of “good practices” for these
					courses. In 2010 the NSF awarded an NSDL grant to make the site public, and it is now hosted by
					the Mathematical Association of America as part of MathDL.

						<dt>Join my queue early</dt>
						<dd>Writing a strong recommendation letter takes thought and time.
							At least <b>one month</b> before the earliest application deadline you have, send me an
							email and provide the following information:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>What are you applying for?</b> Is it a specific program / scholarship or a suite
									of similar applications (graduate programs / REUs / conference funding sources)?
									Please include the names of all programs you're considering. Except in extenuating
									circumstances,
									I ask that you limit the number of programs I'll be sending the letter
									to 8-10 applications.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Why are you applying?</b> and <b>Why are you a strong applicant?</b>
									Understanding your motivations and why you are a good fit for the program you're
									applying
									will help me write a strong and specific letter of support.
									At this stage in the process, I don't need a draft of your application material, but
									I'm happy to read one if you have it.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>How might a letter from me support your application?</b> A highly effective
									letter
									of recommendation typically has details of multiple interactions where the letter
									writer can point to specific reasons why the applicant is well suited for their
									goal.
									To help me determine if I can write a strong letter, please include a summary
									of the context(s) in which I have seen your work.
									<ul>
										<li>
											If you were a student in a class I taught, include the class and the quarter
											as well as the letter grade you received.
											Also include any work you did beyond the usual classwork: did you complete
											extra
											credit questions? attend office hours regularly? contribute to class
											discussions?
										</li>
										<li>
											If you tutored or TAed for me,
											again indicate the class and the quarter and remind
											me of any special roles you played
											(extra review sessions? test-driving exams? writing up homework solutions?).
										</li>
										<li>
											If you worked with me on a special / research project, please
											summarize the goals of the project, the dates you worked on it, your
											specific
											contributions, and any papers you helped author.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Letter of recommendation release form</b> Per UC San Diego guidance, I will need
									you to complete <a href="UCSD-Letter-of-Recommendation-Release-Form.pdf"
										target="_blank">this
										release form</a> to give me permission to send a letter on your behalf. Please
									include the completed form
									(electronic signature is okay) with your initial email request.
								</li>
							</ul>
							I make an effort to respond to these initial requests within one to two weeks.
							If you have not heard back from me after two weeks, and especially if the application
							deadline(s)
							are coming up soon, please send me another email.
						</dd>
						<dt>Gathering your application material</dt>
						<dd>
							Once you have heard back from me and, if I have committed to writing a letter of support,
							I will need the rest of your application materials. In particular,
							it's useful for me to have the deadlines for each program and drafts of any application
							materials you've created at this stage (including personal statement, research statement,
							letter of
							intent, resume, etc.). I typically batch my work on recommendation letters so I may not
							respond to this email until I am uploading the letter of recommendation. If at all possible,
							please make sure I have the links to upload your letter to as many of the places you're
							applying before the earliest deadline. When filling out my information in the "reference
							information"
							field of these applications, use my main email (minnes@ucsd.edu) as my contact email
							and use the CSE Student Affairs main contact number (858-534-8872) for
							applications that require a phone number.
						</dd>

						<dt>Confirmation</dt>
						<dd>I appreciate reminder emails as the deadline for your earliest application nears.
							However, I may not reply to these reminders since I typically batch process letter writing.

					<h2>Information for prospective TAs / tutors</h2>

					<img class="img-fluid" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/formal_logic.png" alt="">Image:
					xkcd.com <br><br>


					<p>I am always happy to work with <b>motivated, responsible, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable</b>
						tutors and TAs.
						If you are interested in one of the courses I am teaching, I encourage you to apply to work with
						me. </p>

					<h3>Before you apply</h3>
					<dl>
						<dt>Committing to be available</dt>
						<dd>
							Your availability during the quarter you are applying to tutor is extremely important. <b>Do
								not apply</b>
							to work with me if you are planning to take a very heavy course load or if you know you will
							be away for more than
							a week during the tutoring/TAing contract.
							If you know you will arrive in San Diego after the first day of the quarter (which is often
							before the first day of instruction) or if you know you will need
							to leave San Diego before the Tuesday after exam week, you must make this clear in your
							application.
						</dd>
						<dt>Crafting your application</dt>
						<dd>You <b>do not need to</b> email me ahead of time expressing your interest. I will
							only consider what you have written in ASES (and any meaningful interactions we've had in
							academic contexts) when screening candidates.
							I do not accept CVs or other letters of intent through email.</dd>
					</dl>

					<h3>A strong application</h3>
					<dl>
						<dt>Centralized CSE ASES application system</dt>
						<dd>The CSE department staff coordinate all TA and tutor appointments and manage
							the contracting process. Instructors can express our preferences
							for who to work with on a course. To come up with my preference list, I review
							the applications
							of students who list the course(s) I will teach as one of their preferred courses.
						</dd>
						<dd>To apply, use the system linked on the CSE department website here
							<a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-tutors"
								target="_blank">https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-tutors</a>
							(for tutors)
							and <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/financial-opportunities/teaching-assistantships"
								target="_blank">https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/financial-opportunities/teaching-assistantships</a>
							(for TAs). The ranked
							order you give to classes matters: the instructor view lists
							interested applicants in the order they ranked my course; I will often find my team among
							applicants who put my course as one of their top
							preference choices.
						</dd>

						<dt>Demonstrating your potential contributions to the instructional team</dt>
						<dd>
							Filling out the ASES application questions carefully is the best way to convince me that you
							are serious
							about working on the course and have the necessary attributes, interest, and time to help
							make
							the course a success.
						</dd>
						<dd>
							Include relevant details in your applications. For example, if you prefer to use a name
							other than your legal name, do mention it. Also, please give a realistic
							picture of your availability by (1)
							indicating any other employment you might pursue for the relevant quarter and (2)
							including
							any potential conflicts you will have with the class in the section
							"Please enter any comments or describe any special circumstances..." . For example, if you
							are planning to take a class
							whose lecture times exactly overlap the lecture (or its discussions) for the class you're
							applying to TA/tutor for,
							you may still be able to do the job but you must let me know ahead of time.
						</dd>
						<dd>
							Many applications essentially say
							"tutors have helped me in the past and I would like to help other people" or
							"I want to help others and I will also learn the material better by teaching it". Those
							sentiments are great, but
							they don't tell me why <b>you</b> are the right person for the job. Add specific details by
							answering all
							of the following questions in your application (you can append these to your answer for any
							of the
							form questions).
							<ul>
								<li>For our class to be successful, it needs to serve *all* of its students. How will
									you work to create an inclusive
									climate for our class and our team? Please be as specific as possible.</li>
								<li>I typically teach classes with significant theoretical and abstract content.
									These classes require effective technical communication from everyone on the
									instructional team.
									Show me you can do this: pick your favorite theorem, algorithm, or fact from this or
									a related class.
									Explain why it's true, why it's interesting, and why you like it.</li>
								<li>Tutoring/TAing is a big time commitment, and will need to be juggled with your own
									coursework.
									How will you ensure that you uphold your responsibilities as a tutor/TA? Give
									specific examples of experiences that have demonstrated your
									ability to meet deadlines, especially in the presence of conflicting demands.</li>
								<li>What is the hardest part of this class? Why? How would you help a student struggling
									with this? Ideally, give specific examples of how you overcame this challenge when
									you were taking this (or a similar) class.</li>
								<li>If you've tutored/TAed before: what is your greatest strength as a tutor/TA? Your
									greatest weakness?</li>
							</ul>
						</dd>
						<dd>
							For <b>TA applicants</b>, I watch the <b>sample teaching video</b> carefully. It can help an
							application stand out, so
							I recommend putting some
							extra effort it. Make sure it is representative of the clarity of your exposition, your
							organizational skills, and your
							enthusiasm.

					<h2>When are my office hours?</h2>

					<p>
						Office hours are a great opportunity for students to come by (in person or virtually) and ask
						questions
						about specific course material, concepts, or related topics. If you're in my class and don't
						have a specific question to ask,
						you're still very welcome to come by during office hours to introduce yourself and join the
						conversation.
					</p>
					<p>My office hour schedule varies from quarter to quarter, depending on my teaching schedule and
						other factors.
						Please check my
						current class calendar(s), website(s) linked above, for this quarter's scheduled office hours.
					</p>

					<p>As part of student engagement efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic,
						I hosted a <a href="https://youtu.be/yCPICpj_1Ic" target="_blank">"Procrastimaking with a
							Professor"</a>
						session with a student team from the Jacobs School EnVision Arts and Engineering Maker Studio
						that covers
						many questions frequently asked during office hours.</p>


					<p>I also host weekly advising / mentoring office hours as part of the UGCom Faculty mentoring
						initiative.
