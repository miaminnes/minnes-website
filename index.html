				<h3>Connecting academics and industry: Internships</h3>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="SummerInternshipSymposium.jpg" alt="">
				<p>I teach a companion class for CSE majors taking industry internships.  In this class, students work to
				identify and deepen the connections between their UCSD studies and real-world problems presented in off-campus
				internships.  Students reflect on the growth of their professional, problem-solving, and technical skills over the internship, 
				as well as the ethical and societal impact of their work.
				At the culmination of this course, students present posters at the Summer Internship Symposium early in 						
				the Fall Quarter.
				All CSE majors are invited to the Symposium, along with alumni and representatives from faculty, the Jacobs school,
 				and industry. The Symposium celebrates our students' accomplishments and strengthens
				the ties between the CSE department and our alumni and industry colleagues. </p>

				<p>The Summer Internship Symposium was featured in the UCTV CSE Channel <a href="https://youtu.be/wYV-ixiwE6E" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/wYV-ixiwE6E</a>.

				<p>Ongoing research on the impact of the internship experience and the additional reflective component
				on students' educational outcomes.  For example, statistically significant improvement in students' demonstrated integrative
				learning can be observed between student writing early in the summer and near the end of the internship.

<i>David worked through notes on Algebra and Logic covering the syntactic
and semantic Lindenbaum algebras.</i><br><br>
</li>

<li>UROP with <b>Maria Monks</b> (Spring 2010)<br>
<i>Maria studied finite automaton presentable groups.  In particular, she looked at a generalization of Thurston automatic groups (finitely generated groups whose Cayley graphs are recognisable by finite automata) using asynchronous automata.  Her results can be found on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3039" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.</i><br><br>
</li>

<li>UROP with <b>Steven Ji</b> (Spring 2009, Fall 2009) <br>
<i>Steven studied finite automaton presentations of the rational numbers.  He has results about the ubiquity of presentations that can be extracted from the lexicographic ordering.</i><br><br>
</li>

<li>UROP with <b>Anna Loparev</b> (Fall 2008) <br>
<i>Anna learned about finite automaton presentable sets of strings and sets of trees. She provided connections between the definitions of labelled trees and finite automata on strings. Throughout, cardinality questions came up and Anna became more familiar with arguments involving countable and uncountable sets.</i>

				<h4>Summer Academy for Incoming Transfer Students 	(<a href="http://academy.eng.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Website</a>)</h4>

				<p>Summer Academy serves incoming transfer students entering UC San Diego in the Fall quarter typcially from a community college.  It is a five-week program where students take gateway courses for their major that are not typically offered at community colleges. The Academy also includes advising and other activities to help students smoothly transition to UC San Diego.

</p>

<p><b>My role:</b> Mentor training and CSE Seminar lead (2016)</p>

				<h4>SPIS: Summer Program for Incoming Students (<a href="http://spis.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Website</a>)</h4>

				<p> SPIS (pronounced "spice") gives students college-level exposure to computer science, emphasizing problem-solving, communication skills, and mathematical modeling. It is a 5-week residential summer program on the UC San Diego campus for students accepted into CSE majors as well as for other UCSD admitted students who want to explore computer science as a career option.
Students in the program interact with a wide range of CSE faculty and learn about computer science and engineering research.
They also have opportunities to connect with engineers from the computer industry. SPIS provides an excellent student experience with individual meetings with faculty, tutoring from experienced CSE undergraduate students, collaborations with fellow students, individual advising to smooth the transition to UCSD, and living on campus.
</p>

<p><b>My role:</b> SPIS Faculty (2013-2016)</p>

				<h4>Communication (<a href="http://mathcomm.org/" target="_blank">Website</a>)</h4>
<p>MathDL Mathematical Communication is a developing collection of resources for engaging students in writing and speaking about mathematics, whether for the purpose of learning mathematics or of learning to communicate as mathematicians.
This site originated in the MIT Department of Mathematics, which offers about ten communication-intensive courses, many of which are led by a different instructor each semester. The department created a website to engage and support this community of instructors and to facilitate the archiving of course materials and the gleaning of “good practices” for these courses.  In 2010 the NSF awarded an NSDL grant to make the site public, and it is now hosted by the Mathematical Association of America as part of MathDL.
</p>
<p><b>My role:</b> Site concept and design, contributor. </p>

			<h2>If you would like to request a reference letter</h2>

			<img class="img-responsive" src="Thumbs_up_icon_fixed.png" alt="">

			<p>Writing a strong recommendation letter takes thought and time.
			At least one month before the deadline, send me an email 
			and provide the following information:
			<ul>
			<li> <b>What are you applying for?</b>  Is it a specific program / scholarship or a suite of similar
			applications (graduate programs / REUs / conference funding sources)? Please include the names of all programs
			you're considering. Except in extenuating circumstances, I ask that you limit the number of programs I'll be sending the letter 
			to 8-10 
			applications. Let me know the deadlines for the letter for each program.</li>
			<li> <b>Why are you applying?</b> Understanding your motivations for graduate school or 
				an internship or a fellowship will help me provide context in my letter. One way for me 
				to learn about your plans may be to see drafts or copies of any application materials
			(personal statement, letter of intent, etc.) you are writing.  Early drafts are fine,
			but I need to know what you've written so that my letter can complement and reinforce your submission.</li>
			<li> <b>Why am I in a good position to write a strong letter?</b> In what context(s) have I seen your work?
			If  you were a student in a class I taught, include the class and the quarter as well as the letter grade you
			received.  Also include any work you did beyond the usual classwork: did you complete extra credit questions?
			attend office hours regularly? contribute to Piazza discussions? <br>
			If you tutored or TAed for me,
			again indicate the class and the quarter and remind me of any special roles you played (extra review sessions?
			test-driving exams? writing up homework solutions?).
			<li> <b>What would you like me to highlight?</b> Are there specific attributes or skills that
			are being sought for in the application that I can speak to? Have you been involved in extracurricular
			activities that are applicable to the application and you'd like me to include?   Were there challenges or
			obstacles that you overcame to reach this stage in your career that could make your application stand out
			(or explain any blips in your transcript)?
			</ul>

			I also need a complete list of URLs / links / email addresses for the reference letter. For applications
			that request snail-mailed letters, a stamped and addressed envelope is appreciated.  Please use the CSE Student
			Affairs main contact number for applications that require my phone number and list minnes@ucsd.edu as my 
			contact email address.

			Per UC San Diego guidance, I will need you to complete  <a href="UCSD-Letter-of-Recommendation-Release-Form.pdf"
			target="_blank">this release form</a> to give me permission to send a letter on your behalf. Please include the completed form
			(electronic signature is okay) with your initial email request.
			</p>

			<h2><a name="tutorTA"></a>Information for prospective TAs / tutors</h2>

			<img class="img-responsive" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/formal_logic.png" alt="">Image: xkcd.com <br><br>


			<p>I am always happy to work with <b>motivated, responsible, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable</b> tutors and TAs.
			If you are interested in one of the courses I am teaching, I encourage you to apply to work with me. 			</p>

			<p>Before you apply: you <b>do not need to</b> email me ahead of time expressing your interest.  I will
only consider what you have written in ASES (and any meaningful interactions we've had in academic contexts) when screening candidates.
I do not accept CVs or other letters of intent through email.</p>

			<p>Your availability during the quarter you are applying to tutor is extremely important.  <b>Do not apply</b>
			to work with me if you are planning to take a very heavy course load or if you know you will be away for more than
			a week during the tutoring/TAing contract.
			If you know you will arrive in San Diego after the first day of the quarter (which is often
before the first day of instruction) or if you know you will need
			to leave San Diego before the Tuesday after exam week, you must make this clear in your application.</p>

			<p> To apply, use the centralized CSE ASES application system linked
			<a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-tutors" target="_blank">here</a> (for tutors)
			and <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/financial-opportunities/teaching-assistantships" target="_blank">here</a> (for TAs). The preference
			order you give to classes matters: I will often find my team among applicants who put my course as one of their top
			preference choices.</p>

			<p>Filling out the ASES application questions carefully is the best way to convince me that you are serious
			about working on the course and have the necessary attributes, passion, and time to help make
			the course a success.
			<ol>
			<li> Fill in all the demographic information accurately.  In particular, if you prefer to use a name
			other than your legal name, do mention it.</li>
			<li> Indicate any other employment you might pursue for the relevant quarter. </li>
			<li> Many applications essentially say "I want to help others and learn the material better by teaching" or
			"tutors have helped me in the past and I would like to help other people".  Those sentiments are great, but
			they don't tell me why <b>you</b> are the right person for the job. Add specific details by answering all
of the following questions in your application:
			<ul>
				<li>For our class to be successful, it needs to serve *all* of its students. How will you work to create an inclusive
					climate for our class and our team? Please be as specific as possible.</li>
				<li>My classes are typically theoretical.  They require effective technical communication from everyone on the instructional team.  Show me you can do this: pick your favorite theorem, algorithm, or fact from this or a related class.  Explain why it's true, why it's interesting, and why you like it.</li>
				<li>Tutoring/TAing is a big time commitment, and will need to be juggled with your own coursework.
How will you ensure that you uphold your responsibilities as a tutor/TA? Give specific examples of experiences that have demonstrated your
ability to meet deadlines, especially in the presence of conflicting demands.</li>
				<li>What is the hardest part of this class? Why? How would you help a student struggling with this?  Ideally, give specific examples of how you overcame this challenge when you were taking this (or a similar) class.</li>
				<li>If you've tutored/TAed before: what is your greatest strength as a tutor/TA? Your greatest weakness?</li>
			</ul>

			<li> For "Please enter any comments or describe any special circumstances...", you must include
			any potential conflicts you will have with the class.  For example, if you are planning to take a class
			whose lecture times exactly overlap the lecture (or its discussions) for the class you're applying to TA/tutor for,
			you may still be able to do the job
			but you must let me know ahead of time.</li>

			<li> For TA applicants, I watch the <b>sample teaching video</b> carefully.  It can help an application stand out, so 
				I recommend putting some 			
			extra effort it.  Make sure it is representative of the clarity of your exposition, your organizational skills, and your 					
			enthusiasm.</li>
			</ol>
</p>

			<h2><a name="officehours"></a>When are my office hours?</h2>

			<p>
				Office hours are a great opportunity for students to come by (in person or virtually) and ask questions 
				about specific course material, concepts, or related topics. If you're in my class and don't have a specific question to ask,
				you're still very welcome to come by during office hours to introduce yourself and join the conversation.
			</p>
			<p>My office hour schedule varies from quarter to quarter, depending on my teaching schedule and other factors.
			Please check my
			current class calendar(s), website(s) linked above, for this quarter's scheduled office hours. </p>

			<p>I also host weekly advising / mentoring office hours as part of the UGCom Faculty mentoring initiative. 
				For more details and the calendar see,
